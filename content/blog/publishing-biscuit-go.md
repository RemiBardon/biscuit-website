The [Golang version of Biscuit](https://github.com/eclipse-biscuit/biscuit-go) now implements
the v2 specification, with a complete parser and some usability improvements.

This project was started two years ago by [@titanous aka Jonathan Rudenberg](https://github.com/titanous)
and [daeMOn63](https://github.com/daeMOn63) while they worked on the open source PaaS
[flynn](https://github.com/flynn/flynn). They have done an amazing work on this library,
and I am happy to see it released!

We're looking for help on this library, suggestions and improvements are welcome, especially
about making a great API. And excited to see it used in new projects!
