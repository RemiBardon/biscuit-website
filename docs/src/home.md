Eclipse Biscuit is an open-source, token-based authorization system.  

With Eclipse Biscuit, you can:

- allow decentralized verification through public key cryptography
- allow offline attenuation where, from each token, a new one with narrower rights can be generated 
- create strong security policy enforcement based on a logic language

Eclipse Biscuit can be used with the command line and support is available in Rust, Haskell, Go, Java, WebAssembly and C.
